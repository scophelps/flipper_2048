# 2048

This is a 2048 game programmed by yours truly to be played on a Flipper Zero. The game itself keeps track of your score and also stores your high score and highest created block on the device. Due to the small screen on the flipper, the blocks increment linearly instead of exponentially ([1, 2, 3, 4] as opposed to [1, 2, 4, 8]). The highest block displays convert to the 2048 equivalent.
